# RobotVacuum

## Our Idea
Due to this aging society, we intended to develop a **robot vacuum** to care for senior citizens. It has the ability not only to clean the floor but also to detect whether they have fallen using a Pi camera and an ML model from google. We record our weekly report on [notion](https://www.notion.so/111-2-81aa25be1b2141e993ead2071728de6c), and [hackmd](https://hackmd.io/@Bing-Wei-Chen/rytEUZ1Lh) for rpi notes

## Hardware
* Arduino Mega 2560 
* Raspberry Pi 4 with Pi cam

## Software
* C++ for Arduino in the dir called arduino
* Python for Rpi in the dir called python
